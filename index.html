<title>CS 184 Final Project Proposal</title>

	<h1> CS184 final project proposal</h1>
	<h2>Peijie Li, Sharon Li</h2>
	<h2>3D fluids simulations and Snow Simulation</h2>
</div>
<!-- <div align = "center" width = "60%"> -->
	<p >In this final project, we would extend our interest in animination simulation and explore more about this interesting topic. From the lecture, we learned about particle simulation and grid-based simulation and hope to explore more. </p>
 <!-- </p> -->
	<h3 align = "middle">A little bit about contexts related to class</h3>
	<p> From my understanding, building these simulations are similar to what we do to build the cloth simulation. We decompose the cloth fiber into huge numbers of point masses and combine forces and springs that connect point masses to simulate the relative movements between each points. However, particle-based simulation decomposes one object into smaller particles to simulate the movement for the shapeless object --- fluid, in this case via position-based simulation. This should be more interesting to apply particles to shape the fluids and to use position-based techniques to decide the position for the particles for next/future time steps and further to manipulate the particles, because the fluid is not of fixed shape and does not have strict tension restrications like the string in the cloth simulation. Therefore, we want to use particle simulation to mimic the movement of the shapeless fluids by predicting the positions for each points. This can be achieved by performing numerical integration to compute each particle's change in position. In class we are introduced to a few ways of integrating our equations, including Euler's method (explicit and implicit), Verlet algorithm, Runge-Kutta method. We will further decide a best strategy in doing integration. In addition to fluid, we want to simulate the snow by applying both particle and grid system. We can compare the results and hopefully this should give us better understanding about the pros and cons of both representations.</p>
	
	<h3 align = "middle">Goal</h3>
	<p>We would like to build a interactive system to play around with both simulation. </p>
	<p>For the fluids simulation, we can provide interactive system with features like: </p>
	<p>1) the weather master: applying winds, rains or flood to the scene (fluid) in order to either add external force to influence the direction of fluid movement, or increase/decrease the fluid flow and further influence the fluid movements directions/strength; </p>
	<p>2) the architect: placing/removing objects in the middle of the fluid and have the fluid flow reacts/collides correspondingly. </p>

	<p>In the fluid simulation, we want to first achieve wave movement and then fluid falling down. With the fluid falling down, we want to create a simulation of raining within a scenes to show the collisions within the scene, such as the water drops collides on the surface of the fluid and then becoming part of the fluid flow. </p>

	<p>Taking a step further, in the snow simulation, we want to create different scenes that contains different objects and environments and the user can shoot snow balls towards the scenes. We will aim to include features that let the user decide how they would like to throw the ball (the direction and the strength of the force he applies to the snow ball) and show the appropriate collision effects via gui manipulation.</p>

	<p>Further idea regarding our fluid and snow simulation will be integrating both into one: simulate a snow ball thrown into a fluid. This is a more challenging practice but we will see if we are able to try it.</p>

<!-- Title, Summary and Team Members
Provide us a descriptive title, 2-3 sentences that summarize your project, and list your two team members.
Problem Description
Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.
Goals and Deliverables
This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).
Schedule
In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.
Resources
List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here. -->
