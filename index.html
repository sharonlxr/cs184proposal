<title>CS 184 Final Project Proposal</title>

	<h1> CS184 final project proposal</h1>
	<h2>Peijie Li, Sharon Li</h2>
	<h2>3D fluids simulations and Snow Simulation</h2>
	<p >In this final project, we would extend our interest in animination simulation and explore more about this interesting topic. From the lecture, we learned some about partical simulation and grid-based simulation. </p>
 <!-- </p> -->
	<h3>A little bit about contexts related to class</h3>
	<p> This is similar to what we have about cloth simulation. We decompose the cloth fiber into huge numbers of point mass and combine forces and strings  connecting point mass to simulate  the contraction between each points. However, partical-based means that decomposes one object into smaller particals to simulate the movement for the shapeless object --- fluid, in this case via position-based simulation. This shoule be more interesting to apply particals to shape the fluids and use position-based technics to manipulate the particals, because the fluids is not fixed shape and does not have strict restrications like the string in the cloth simulation. Therefore, we want to use partical simulation to mimic the movement of the shapeless fluids through predicting the positions for each points. In addition to fluid, we want to simulate snow by applying both partical and grid system. This should give us better understanding about both and compare the behaviours.</p>
	
	<h3>Goal</h3>
	<p>We would like to build a interactive system to play around with both simulation. For the fluids simulation, we can provide interactive system to added external force like winds or motion applied on the gui to control the direction of movement we are expecting. In the snow simulation, we want to create different scenes containing different objects and environments and we can use gui to shoot snow balls towards the scenes with the user applies motion to control direction via the gui.</p>
	<p>In the fluid simulation, we want to first achieve wave movement and then fluid falling down. With the fluid falling down, we want to create a simulation of raining within a scenes containig some objects and enviroment to show the collision with the scenes and the different absorbing/perserving of rains of on the groud of the enviroment. </p>

	<h3>Schedule</h3>
	<p>Week 1 : Finalize all functions should be supported and all related sources.</p>
	<p>Week 2 : Starting formulating approaches and coding.</p>
	<p>Week 3 : Debugging , testing for more demos/paramters, comparing these two simulations, and formulating report. </p>
	<p>Week 4 : finishing up websites. </p>

<!-- Title, Summary and Team Members
Provide us a descriptive title, 2-3 sentences that summarize your project, and list your two team members.
Problem Description
Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.
Goals and Deliverables
This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).
Schedule
In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.
Resources
List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here. -->
